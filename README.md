# Title: Neuroethological Modelling of Insect Olfactory Behaviour: Computational & Bio-inspired Insights
## Goal: Produce an original research article through simulations and theory (no paywalled data). Deliver a reusable simulated dataset, GLM baseline, spiking model, analyses, figures, and manuscript.
## Why: Avoids dependency on paywalled experimental data while delivering new, testable computational insights linking insect olfaction to neural circuit principles and sensor design.
Approach — short:

Build synthetic, biologically plausible dataset for ~21 insect species (pheromone conc, duration, temp, light, movement probability).

Fit GLM logistic models per species and a pooled hierarchical model.

Implement a small LIF-based sensory→decision module to show how simple networks can produce observed dose–response curves.

Perform sensitivity/ablation analyses and cluster species by inferred sensitivity.
Deliverables: validated simulation code, data/simulated_dataset.csv, notebooks for EDA + modelling, 4 publication-quality figures, manuscript draft.
Scope & novelty: Combines zoological mechanism grounding (pheromone-driven decisions) with neural-inspired modelling and produces testable predictions for experiments and bio-inspired sensor design.
